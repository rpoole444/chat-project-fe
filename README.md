    - “user 1"
    - "user 2" (for testing purposes)
2. npm i in each
3. obtain api key
4. set said key in your .env file
5. npm start
    - first user
    - you should see a little message bubble in the bottom right @ local3000

    - cd into the second user file
    - npm run build
    - npx serve -s build -l 5000
7. Navigate in a normal window to your local 3000,
